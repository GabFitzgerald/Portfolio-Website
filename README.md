### Target audience
This portfolio is targeted at potential employers, clients or anyone looking to view my details of my development projects. This is why the website has a strong focus on the work and the projects themselves with some personality put into the styling, the bottom of the portfolio blog roll and the projects themselves, but the work it the first thing seen. Social links appear twice on every page to encourage the viewer to connect with me, and there is a call to action at the bottom of every page to encourage the visitor to email me, see more details in my github, view another project, or connect with me on social media. Ultimately the website is a showcase of what I have been working on and a pathway to connect with me.

### Tech Stack
The website was build with HTML and CSS.
