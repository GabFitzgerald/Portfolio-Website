## Description of the portfolio website
### Purpose 
The purpose of this website is to showcase my work and provide a gateway to connect with potential employers or clients. The main page of the website is a blogroll of all my recent projects ordered from most recent to oldest. All posts are dated with a small description of the project and a thumbnail image. A "View Project" button links to a details page which gives much more information about the projects. These pages include larger sections of text giving more detail about the project, images, embedded tweets, and a highlighted "What I learned from This Project section" to demonstrate a growth mindset. The bottom of each page also has a call to action section which encourages the viewer to connect with me via email, or to view more details of the project on my github. Additionally, navigation on each page will direct the user to the adjacent post, or back to the main page. 

I have chosen to include recent projects from coder academy including the terminal app and the banking app as well as other projects I am working on in my own time. Specifically, the banking app is there labeled as my first coding project, and dated, to show my progress throughout the blog roll. Prior to that, I have also include a post about my Bachelor of Science. I particularly wanted to showcase some of my exposure to statistics, R, python and matlab, as well as a deep and nuanced understanding of human anatomy, physiology and pharmocology. I've also included a post about my experience with Startup Academy at UQ which helped give me some business vocabulary and untimately lead me to coder academy and the tech industry. Overall, the purpose of the blog roll design  is the tell the story of Gab Fitzgerald, the developer. 

### Target audience
This portfolio is targeted at potential employers, clients or anyone looking to view my details of my development projects. This is why the website has a strong focus on the work and the projects themselves with some personality put into the styling, the bottom of the portfolio blog roll and the projects themselves, but the work it the first thing seen. Social links appear twice on every page to encourage the viewer to connect with me, and there is a call to action at the bottom of every page to encourage the visitor to email me, see more details in my github, view another project, or connect with me on social media. Ultimately the website is a showcase of what I have been working on and a pathway to connect with me.

### Sitemap

With a strong focus on showcasing my work, the blog roll is the first thing on the home page. Each project summary links out to a project details page. Each project details page links to the next, and previous one, and back to the blog roll. The about me section is found at the bottom of the blog roll, but can be accessed by the header on all pages. Same with the resume page, which can be access by the header. Social links to twitter, linkedin and github are present in the header and footer of every page.

### Components

- **Header-nav**: my name, portfolio, about, resume, social links

The header is present on every page for easy and consistent navigation throughout the website. My name is in the top left corner of both the desktop and mobile versions so that it is present and obvious for the viewer. It also include socials links to encourage the viewer to connect with me from the start of the page.

- **Footer**: social links, back-to-top-nav, copyright (my name again)

The chevron navigates back to the top, so the user can access the header again quickly. Social links are there to again encourage the user to connect with me. The copyright serves a few purposes. It attributes the work to me, explains the languages used to build the site and reminds the viewer of my name again.

- **About me**: photo, description

![about me section screenshots](/docs/about_me_screenshot.png)

This section is located at the bottom of the portfolio blog roll. I put it there to let the work speak first, then allow to viewer to learn a bit about me if they are interested. I've included a photo and a description to show some personality, and show a little bit of who I am.


- **Portfolio blog roll**: thumbnail photo, date of project, title, tech stack

This is really the heart of the website as the main showcase of my previous work. I've styled each post on a card with some box shadow to make them stand out. I've added a thumbnail image for some interest on the page. Then added a caption including the date of the work (to show my progress/growth), the title of the project and a short description including the technology used. There is also a "view project" link which links to the details page for each project. This allows the viewer to browse my works and get a good idea of what I know, (e.g. ruby, html, css, likes music and has a BSc) then get more detail about a project if they are interested.

- **Portfolio details**: descriptions (>50words), images, embedded tweets, what I learned, call to action

![blog post screenshot](/docs/blog_post_screenshot.png)

Each post is to give more details about each of the project I've worked on. The text is styled with a maximum of 50 words per paragraph so that it looks like I have something to say, but is still readable. They include images, embedded tweeted and lists to keep the post visually interesting, and the viewer more likely to read on. 

![what i learned screenshot](/docs/what_i_learned_screenshot.png)

I've included a "What I Learned" section to each post to show that as a new developer I'm doing my best to pick up new skills and also to demonstrate soft skills such as growth mindset and positive attitude.

![call to action screenshot](/docs/call_to_action_screenshot.png)

Every post finishes with a call to action for once the viewer has finished reading the post. They can email me; clicking my email will open a prefilled email addressed to me. Or they can find more details in my github which is also linked.

- **Portfolio details nav**: next/previous/back-to-all projects

![blogs posts navigation](/docs/project_details_nav.png)

This was added at the bottom of each project details page to be the next logical step for the viewer. If they have finished reading the details of my project, and are not called to action, then they can look at my next/previous project, or go back to the blog roll of projects.

- **Resume**: image, link to pdf

If the viewer is a potential employer and is interested in looking at my resume, they can also do that from the website itself, or download a pdf to save for later.
