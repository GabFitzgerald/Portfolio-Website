## Description of the portfolio website
### Purpose 
The purpose of this website is to showcase my work and provide a gateway to connect with potential employers or clients. The main page of the website is a blogroll of all my recent projects ordered from most recent to oldest. All posts are dated with a small description of the project and a thumbnail image. A "View Project" button links to a details page which gives much more information about the projects. These pages include larger sections of text giving more detail about the project, images, embedded tweets, and a highlighted "What I learned from This Project section" to demonstrate a growth mindset. The bottom of each page also has a call to action section which encourages the viewer to connect with me via email, or to view more details of the project on my github. Additionally, navigation on each page will direct the user to the adjacent post, or back to the main page. 

I have chosen to include recent projects from coder academy including the terminal app and the banking app as well as other projects I am working on in my own time. Specifically, the banking app is there labeled as my first coding project, and dated, to show my progress throughout the blog roll. Prior to that, I have also include a post about my Bachelor of Science. I particularly wanted to showcase some of my exposure to statistics, R, python and matlab, as well as a deep and nuanced understanding of human anatomy, physiology and pharmocology. I've also included a post about my experience with Startup Academy at UQ which helped give me some business vocabulary and untimately lead me to coder academy and the tech industry. Overall, the purpose of the blog roll design  is the tell the story of Gab Fitzgerald, the developer. 

### Target audience
This portfolio is targeted at potential employers, clients or anyone looking to view my details of my development projects. This is why the website has a strong focus on the work and the projects themselves with some personality put into the styling, the bottom of the portfolio blog roll and the projects themselves, but the work it the first thing seen. Social links appear twice on every page to encourage the viewer to connect with me, and there is a call to action at the bottom of every page to encourage the visitor to email me, see more details in my github, view another project, or connect with me on social media. Ultimately the website is a showcase of what I have been working on and a pathway to connect with me.

### Sitemap

With a strong focus on showcasing my work, the blog roll is the first thing on the home page. Each project summary links out to a project details page. Each project details page links to the next, and previous one, and back to the blog roll. The about me section is found at the bottom of the blog roll, but can be accessed by the header on all pages. Same with the resume page, which can be access by the header. Social links to twitter, linkedin and github are present in the header and footer of every page.
